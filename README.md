## Project Background
In this project, we are going to dive through the datasets of an ecommerce online shop's user event history in electronics field specifically with the purpose of improving budget relocation for sales, product, and marketing. With over 800k instances collected by Open CDP project, we will perform sale trend, funnel, and product analysis with time dimension of 5 months (Oct 2020-Feb 2021). 

## Executive Summary
The store's 5-month records show monthly revenue fluctuating around $0.9 million, with a continuously increasing trend from October 2020 to January 2021 but a slightly decrease in February 2021. Among all categories of product, `computers` has contributed to the greatest proportion of sales, 87%, whereas `electronics` products account for 11% of revenue, ranking in the 2nd. The conversion rate of view to cart has increased from 7% to 9% though the purchase conversion rate has dropped from 72% to 65% could be a potential concern. The store can benefit from expanding top product lines and shifting focuses to frequently viewed products. Targeted improvements to low purchase conversion rate products will drive sustainable growth for the store.
